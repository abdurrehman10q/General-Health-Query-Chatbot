            "Sore throats are very common and can be caused by a variety of things! Here are some of the most frequent culprits:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Viral Infections:** This is by far the most common cause. Viruses like those that cause the common cold, the flu, mononucleosis (mono), measles, chickenpox, and even COVID-19 can all lead to a sore throat.\n",
            "*   **Bacterial Infections:** The most well-known bacterial cause is **strep throat** (streptococcal pharyngitis). This requires antibiotics to treat. Other bacterial infections like tonsillitis or epiglottitis can also cause a sore throat.\n",
            "*   **Allergies:** Allergic reactions to pollen, pet dander, dust mites, or mold can cause a sore throat, often accompanied by postnasal drip, sneezing, and itchy eyes.\n",
            "*   **Dryness:** Dehydration, breathing through your mouth (especially when sleeping), or dry indoor air can make your throat feel dry, scratchy, and sore.\n",
            "*   **Irritants:**\n",
            "    *   **Smoke:** Cigarette smoke (firsthand or secondhand) and other types of smoke can irritate the throat.\n",
            "    *   **Pollution:** Air pollution or chemical fumes.\n",
            "    *   **Voice Strain:** Yelling, singing loudly, or talking excessively can strain your throat muscles and make them sore.\n",
            "*   **Acid Reflux (GERD):** Stomach acid backing up into the esophagus (acid reflux) can irritate the throat, especially at night or in the morning.\n",
            "*   **Less Common Causes:** In some cases, a sore throat could be due to a tumor, HIV infection, or other rare conditions, but these are much less common than the causes listed above.\n",
            "\n",
            "If you're experiencing a sore throat and are concerned, or if it's severe, persistent, or accompanied by other worrying symptoms like a high fever, difficulty swallowing, or swollen glands, it's always best to **consult a licensed doctor** for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.\n"
